## Note: 
This protocol is similar to the protocol developed by the Hughes lab at Northeastern University, but has been adapted for the Lotterhos lab eastern oyster seascape genomics project. We have adjusted sample volume, assay volumes, and automated data analysis steps.

-   'MasterMix:' When we order the 5 mL volume, we can run 8 plates with this amount. We make 8 aliquots of 625 ul each into 1.5 mL low-bind tubes and immediately store them in the 5C fridge. Each plate requires 618 ul of MM, so there is a small amount of buffer room for pipetting error. Do not contaminate the mastermix! It should only be pipetted away from any positives or DNA samples in a separate sterile workspace. 

-   'Primers and Probes:'
